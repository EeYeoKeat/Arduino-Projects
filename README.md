# Arduino-Projects

Once a while in my university degree, I was fully work on Arduino projects for whole semester. After few years, I still keep it as little hobby.

# Arduino Board

Arduino board is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It is a good starting point for who interested to learn how to build a device and program it.
